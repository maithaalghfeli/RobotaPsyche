# Paper Proposal:

## Topic: Robots and Cinema

For this proposed topic, I am interested in exploring the history of robots in cinema and media. How have robots been represented in cinema throughout history? Utopian and Dystopian takes on robots and robot consciousness, the representations of ethics or good and evil, robotic warfare, robotic emotions, etc. 

The list is endless here and I am yet to narrow it down, but focusing on cinema in specific whether it be films targeted for children or adults and how they differ in cultural nuances not just of countries and nations but of smaller groups such as age groups, religion, and education.

### Narrowed Topics: 
- Robots in Kids' Cinema
- Emotions and Robots in Cinema
- Gender Takes on Robots in Cinema
- Robot Revolution
- Consciousness of Cyborgs in Cinema: How human are they?
