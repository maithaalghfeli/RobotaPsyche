# OXYGEN CHAMBER

## Description: 

For the Ecosystem Project inspired by Braitenberg's Vehicles, I decided to implement a system manipulated by oxygen levels. The program is a simplified simulation of an ecosystem where organisms are attracted to an oxygen tank in the middle.
 
The colour of the oxygen tank reflects oxygen levels in the ecosystem:

- Green == Abundant Oxygen 
- Yellow == Low Oxygen 
- Red == No Oxygen 

The speed of the organisms, as well as their concentration around the tank, is affected by the oxygen levels. Abundant oxygen yields higher speeds and freer movement, lower oxygen yields slower speeds and more concentration around the tank. 

To manipulate the oxygen levels, move your mouse around the tank:

- Mouse far from the tank == Green
- Mouse around the tank == Yellow
- Mouse inside the tank == Red

## Problems & Difficulties:

**Difficulties:**

- I had a hard time sticking to my initial idea, therefore I kept changing the code to be more receptive and realistic to my own coding skills. ***(AMBITION IS NICE, BUT TOO MUCH OF IT CAN BURN YOU OUT)***
- I intended to implement a timed countdown for the organisms that do not make it into the oxygen tank during the red period, where the organism would be eliminated from the ecosystem, therefore reflecting death. Unfortunately, I did not know how to do that.
- Some of the organisms leave the tank even during the red or the yellow periods, I wasn't sure how to fix the attraction/repelsion of the organisms in that instance besides adjusting their velocity. 
- Wasting time on aesthetics whilst simultaneusly losing precious time to finish the code is definitely something I should improve on. 

**Solutions:**

- I learned not to complicate things, simplified shapes can be more beneficial than detailed ones. 
- Focus on how well the code runs over the aesthetics. 
- Comment as you work, it helps clear out any confusion while working or editing. 
- Maybe I shouldn't kill my organisms if they don't get enough oxygen, it's kind of unethical LOL!
